## Dashboard Motivation: Why?

My dashboard is a dash app created for Bhumi NGO. Bhumi is a non-profit organization that focuses on providing education to underprivileged children in India. The organization has several programs that aim to improve the quality of education and create opportunities for children living in shelter homes, orphanages, and slums.

Ignite is one of Bhumi's programs that is focused on providing digital literacy and computer education to children in underprivileged communities. The program aims to bridge the digital divide and equip children with the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century.who has been teaching.
