With a vision of creating an equal society, Bhumi operates across multiple states in India and engages with over 25,000 volunteers to drive social change.
                       Bhumi offers a range of programs that focus on areas such as education, skill development, and environmental sustainability. Their flagship program, the Ignite Program, focuses on providing education and life skills to children from orphanages, shelters, and slum communities. Additionally, Bhumi also conducts several other programs such as the Career Development Program, which aims to provide career guidance and mentorship to underprivileged youth, and the Green Bhumi Program, which focuses on promoting environmental sustainability. Through their various initiatives, Bhumi has impacted the lives of thousands of children and youth, providing them with opportunities to realize their full potential and lead a better life.'''),

Bhumi people need to explain to individuals about the location of the centers in the city, number of the kids in the center and the existing number of volunteers in that particular shelter home and the number of volunteers they are in need of.

With these conditions in mind, he can use the application Bhumi to see the location of all the centers where Bhumi is involved to identify the nearest one to his residence. He can also compare the children available and the volunteer available for each center which will make him understand which center is in immediate need of volunteers. Sriram can use application `Bhumi` in order to make a choice that matches his conditions.
